# Build-2 Development Session

**Session File**: `.claude/sessions/2025-08-06-build-2.md`

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-06
- **Project**: NCDB2Phx - Ash Framework sync engine for Phoenix applications
- **Session Type**: Development Session

## Goals

  ● I can see the issue! The error is:

    ** (ArgumentError) The module NCDB2PhxWeb.Telemetry was given as a child to a supervisor but it does not exist

    The problem is in the ncdb_2_phx dependency's Application.start/2 function. It's trying to start NCDB2PhxWeb.Telemetry but this module doesn't
     exist. Looking at the system reminder, I can see in the application.ex file:

    children = [
      # Start the Telemetry supervisor
      NCDB2PhxWeb.Telemetry,  # <-- This module doesn't exist
      # Start the PubSub system
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: NCDB2Phx.PubSub},
      # Start the Finch HTTP client for making external requests
      {Finch, name: NCDB2Phx.Finch}
    ]

    This is a configuration issue in the ncdb_2_phx package. The ncdb_2_phx library shouldn't be trying to start its own Phoenix application - it
    should be designed as a library that integrates with your Phoenix app.

    Immediate solutions:

    1. Report this as a bug to the ncdb_2_phx repository - the package shouldn't be trying to start web modules
    2. Temporarily remove the dependency until it's fixed
    3. Check if there's a configuration to disable the Phoenix application startup

    Let me check what's in the application configuration:

  ● Read(lib/ncdb_2_phx/application.ex)
    ⎿  Read 24 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
    ⎿  CLAUDE.md

  ● The issue is clear now. The ncdb_2_phx package is incorrectly configured as a Phoenix application rather than a library. It's trying to start
    web components (NCDB2PhxWeb.Telemetry) that don't exist.

    The fix needed in ncdb_2_phx package:

    The application.ex should be configured for a library, not a web application. It should probably look like:

    def start(_type, _args) do
      children = [
        # Only start essential services for the library
        {Phoenix.PubSub, name: NCDB2Phx.PubSub},
        {Finch, name: NCDB2Phx.Finch}
        # Remove NCDB2PhxWeb.Telemetry - this shouldn't exist in a library
      ]

      opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: NCDB2Phx.Supervisor]
      Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
    end

### Session Notes
- Working with Elixir/Phoenix project using Ash Framework
- Project is a package/library for sync operations with no-code databases
- Following Ash conventions and patterns strictly
