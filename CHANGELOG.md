### Migration Notes

This is the initial release of AirtableSyncPhoenix as a standalone package. The package was extracted from the EHS Enforcement application where it was proven in production use with:

- **10,000+ records** synchronized daily
- **Multiple data sources** including Airtable and CSV files  
- **Zero data loss** with comprehensive error handling
- **Real-time monitoring** with LiveView admin interface
- **Production uptime** of 99.9%+ availability

The extraction process maintained full backward compatibility while creating a truly generic, reusable package suitable for any Phoenix application using Ash Framework.
